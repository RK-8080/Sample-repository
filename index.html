<p>When I first heard of the term ‘Inbound Marketing’, I did not think much of it. I thought maybe it was just another marketing gimmick. Much later did I realize that my understanding of it was far from the truth. I then did some research to get acquainted with this concept. I was reading up on articles about it online, started following popular blogs on this topic and even took some online courses to further my understanding. But translating this idea of Inbound Marketing into a blog – one that did not just plainly lay out the facts of Inbound Marketing – seemed to be a rather difficult task than one imagined it to be.

<p> So I started searching for examples of brands that I may have used in my life that fit the concept of inbound marketing, and I was in for a major surprise! Sure, in the present day, there are numerous brands that use Inbound Marketing methodologies, but the one that came to mind wasn’t a new brand at all, and definitely wasn’t perceived as Inbound either. It had been around since 1998 and attained global popularity by 2002 and since then has been silently doing some terrific work, all the while making it look so effortless and matter of fact. Yes, you guessed it right. I am referring to Google.

<h2>Why Google?</h2>

<p>While there are several reasons why I consider Google to be inbound, let’s start with the most basic one which I am sure most of us have experienced. Remember back in early 2000s when the most popular search engine available was still Yahoo? One fine day I came to know about this new search engine called Google and the inquisitive student that I was back then, wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I typed in google.com into Netscape Navigator browser (Yes I know, Google is that old!) and was immediately disappointed. The page did not seem to fully load! Where were the colorful images, banner advertisements and unnecessary hyperlinks that I was so used to seeing in Yahoo Search? See below image for a comparison.

<p>I hit refresh button a few times with no success. Thinking the problem was with Netscape Navigator, I tried loading the Google page in Internet Explorer. But I was still seeing the same page having more white spaces than text. I was intrigued. Was this a beta version? Are they still testing it? Why were they not interested in filling up their home page with advertisements like all other web sites did?

<h2>Attract</h2>

<p>Later when I read ‘The Google Story’ by David Vise, I was super excited to learn the reason for this. Google wanted to do the opposite of what Yahoo did. Even before its users had a chance to search using its search engine, Yahoo was diverting the users to other web pages (within and outside of Yahoo) inundating them with news and articles through their banner advertisements and category links. These users eventually bookmarked the destination web pages and would then directly go to those pages instead of using Yahoo search engine to find what they were looking for. Also, it was natural to do so as search engine results were not considered to be very fast, relevant or accurate back then. By not having any unnecessary links or advertisements in its home page, Google on the other hand, was attracting any and every internet user to try its search engine and then gave them relevant links as search results. And all this was achieved without placing a single print, radio, television or billboard ad to promote its search engine (The very first Google search engine ad was a television commercial aired during the 2010 Super Bowl in the US)

<h2>Convert & Close</h2>

<p>Eventually high usage of its search engine led to better search results. But Google did not stop there. It constantly updated and tweaked its then famous PageRank search logic to guarantee accurate and relevant search results with every single search query. Updates also ensured that black hat SEO tactics that became prevalent later on did not influence the search results (this was Google paying attention to the changing Web landscape). Google also heavily invested in continuously indexing and archiving the millions of web pages of the growing World Wide Web using sophisticated crawlers and spider bots. This ensured that search results were fast, really fast (milliseconds compared to the 5+ seconds taken by the likes of Yahoo, Altavista and Lycos)

<p>And by consistently providing accurate and fast search results every single time, Google succeeded in converting loyal visitors into loyal customers – the ones who stuck to the Google brand no matter which browser or operating system they went on to adopt later. Searching the internet using Google became so mundane that Google itself became synonymous with internet. Internet cafes around the world started using the Google logo in their storefront signboards to attract customers (talk about brand power!). And Google soon became a verb “to google” or “googling”. It was added to both the Oxford English Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in 2006. Very few brands have managed to pull off such a rare feat (Xerox comes to mind)

<h2>Delight</h2>

<p> Remember the first time when you typed in your search query with a few typos and Google made an intuitive auto-correct suggestion with “Did you mean…?” (even Microsoft Word was not that intuitive then) That was definitely a wow moment for me! Later in 2010, google dazzled us with an even more delightful ‘instant’ feature. Google was eager to provide search results faster than you could completely type in your search query! How’s that for fast? (Years later, Google discontinued instant to focus more on customer’s shifting preference towards mobile searches - Yet another indicator of Google closely following customer behavior changes). But perhaps the biggest indication of delighting customers almost on a daily basis is via Google Doodles in its home page – those geography specific small sketches and short animated audio visual tributes to notable visionaries, events and places round the globe all through the year. Right from celebrating the contributions of the likes of Nikola Tesla, Charlie Chaplin or Helen Keller, to special events specific to each country such as the Chinese New Year or Diwali, to popular and fun anniversaries, we have seen and experienced it all via the Doodle.

<p> It just felt like Google had forgotten to put on the brakes and went on a serial-delighting spree churning out feature after feature including, Gmail, Google Scholar, Google Maps, Google Translate, Google Finance and Google Health just to name a few. The list was never-ending and I was always excited to find out what was brewing next in Google Labs – many of those magic potions currently reside in our laptops, tablets and smartphones.

<p> Even with the massive growth of Google Ads and with around 93% of all worldwide searches now flowing through Google (with it now being seen as an advertising platform first and a search engine second), it never compromised on what users have been coming to it for since 2002 – Accurate, reliable and fast information reachable within a finger tap.

<p> Had Google just inadvertently created an Inbound blueprint? One that other digital companies can adopt? I am truly surprised at the way some brands can show Inbound tendencies even if they have not consciously sought to do so. Does this beg the question – Will all brands go Inbound in some or the other fashion, consciously or unconsciously? Well, that remains to be seen.
